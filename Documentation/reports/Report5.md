### Weekly report 5


## What's been done this week

Relievingly, the program was accepted for the peer review. I've done a lot of refactoring, while at the same time tweaked the build.gradle files and the general structure of the program.

## The implementation

The implementation should now be very close to finalization. I need to add some documentation along with the tests. I had some problems getting the test classes to work, but they should be working now (after having done a bunch of tweaks to the build.gradle files and a lot of troubleshooting). The workload's been quite heavy, but I'm satisfied that it seems I'll be able to complete the course. I've learned a lot about java coding during these past three months and now feel a lot more ready to take on the other courses.

## Problems and questions for next week

I need to get the test classes done, as well as the rest of the documentation. After that, I hope I've done what is needed to pass the course.
