### Weekly report 6


## What's been done this week

I've done some refactoring, but mostly been focusing on testing and getting the documentation done. 

## The implementation

To me, the code itself is ready. It might not be working perfectly, but I hope it's good enough to pass the reviews and get me the grade. I've been testing the program manually and trying to find the sweet spot for different parametres, that would produce the most viable real names. Order 3, Dataset size somewhere around 200 and 500 and short enough names (4-6 letters) seems to be doing quite okay.

## Problems and questions for next week

No problems or questions at this point. Waiting to write the final report next week and then getting a change to run a demo of my program at some point in May.
