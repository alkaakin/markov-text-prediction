### Weekly report 4 

## What's been done this week

A full revamp of the code. I had a call with the instructor and we discussed the implementation. 

## The implementation

I did some work with the different classes and tried to tidy up the whole code a bit. There are problems with different sections still. The biggest problem is though that as of Saturday the code isn't working. There's an index out of bounds problem with the findTrie method, that is used to find the possible children of a particular node and weigh them accordingly. The problem seems to be with handling the two lists (one for characters, second one for values or frequencies). Both the characters and the frequencies are stored in the nodes.

## Problems and questions for next week

I need to get the code working before tomorrow night (Sunday). Let's see how it goes, since there are time constraints. It's a big problem for me that I haven't fully grasped the main logic of the algorithm until now (hopefully I understand it now...). This is really constraining and the whole course is just an awful lot of work to be combined with full-time work alongside. But choices, choices...
