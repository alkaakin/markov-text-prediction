### Weekly report 2


## What's been done this week

I regretfully haven't had much time to concentrate on the course this week, but next week will be different - I'll be aiming to implement the whole program as fully as I can during next week. There seems to be an issue with the way I've framed the project - the name I'm using for it is "text prediction" which seems to be a whole different thing from text generation.

## The implementation

I haven't implemented the program this week, but I've been planning it more thoroughly this time. It seems I need to think about the whole implementation with my course instructor, since I'm still a bit unsure about what kind of input I'm supposed to use and how it's going to lead to the wanted solution (text generation). To be fair, I guess I need to think thoroughly about what to store in the trie (letters/n-grams/full words) and how to use these for text generation. 

## Problems and questions ahead

I feel like at this point it's useless to try and advance the program by myself, so I need to talk about the implementation with my instructor. A lot of time has already been spent by trying to implement the program in the wrong way.

## Next week

Next week, I'm discussing the implementation with the course instructor, after which my aim is to complete the basics for the program. I'm aiming for an ambitious schedule to be able to start implementing tests already the week after that.
